<h2 align="left">Introduction</h2>

###

<p align="left">Hello, my name is Aryan F.P., and I'm a third-year student at the University of Western. First of all, I'd like to thank you for downloading Enscribe. This project has been a labor of love, born out of a desire to eliminate the struggle of taking notes during lectures.<br><br>As a student, I've always found it challenging to balance listening to the professor and jotting down notes at the same time. I often prefer to fully engage with what the professor is saying, but that can come at the cost of missing out on important details that I would otherwise note down. This is where Enscribe comes into play.</p>

###

<h2 align="left">What is Enscribe</h2>

###

<p align="left">Enscribe is designed to record the transcription of your lecture and convert it into text that you can reference later. The idea is simple: instead of frantically trying to keep up with note-taking during class, you can focus on listening and understanding the material. Enscribe handles the rest.</p>

###

<h2 align="left">How Does Enscribe Work?</h2>

###

<p align="left">Imagine you're in a lecture, and your professor is presenting a PDF slide deck. If the professor has shared that PDF with the class, you can import it into Enscribe. As the lecture progresses, Enscribe will record the audio and transcribe it in real-time. It then matches this transcription to the specific slides from the PDF. This way, you can easily navigate through the lecture using just a few buttons—no more than three—and Enscribe takes care of the rest.<br><br>The result? You'll have a complete, searchable text of the lecture, synced with the corresponding slides. This feature allows you to review the lecture at your own pace, ensuring you don’t miss any crucial information.</p>

###

<h2 align="left">Upcoming Features</h2>

###

<p align="left">We're working on a comprehensive settings page that will allow you to customize your Enscribe experience. Whether it’s adjusting transcription accuracy, selecting your preferred language, or configuring shortcuts, the settings page will put you in control.<br><br> Currently, Enscribe is available on Windows, but we're working hard to bring full support to MacOS users. The goal is to ensure that Enscribe is accessible to all students, regardless of their operating system.<br><br> We plan to enhance how Enscribe interacts with PDF files, adding features like annotations, highlights, and the ability to insert your own notes directly into the synced lecture slides.<br><br> Soon, you’ll be able to share your lecture notes with classmates, collaborate on annotations, and even create group study sessions directly within Enscribe.</p>

<h2 align="left">Why Enscribe?</h2>

###

<p align="left">Enscribe is more than just a note-taking tool—it's a way to enhance your learning experience. By focusing on listening rather than writing, you can engage more deeply with the material being taught. This is especially useful in complex subjects where understanding the lecture in real-time is crucial.<br>The result? You'll have a complete, searchable text of the lecture, synced with the corresponding slides. This feature allows you to review the lecture at your own pace, ensuring you don’t miss any crucial information.</p>
