All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

### Added
- **Automatic Button Interface Close:** When changing between different notes, the button interface will now automatically close upon selecting a note.
- **Remember User Account for 30 Days:** Added a feature to remember the user's account login for 30 days.

### Fixed
- **Transcript Not Displayed in Correct Order:** Fixed an issue where transcripts were not displaying in the correct order.
- **Audio File Not Displayed in Correct Order:** Resolved the issue of audio files not appearing in the proper order.
- **Click on Transcript Closes PDF File:** Clicking on the transcript bubble will no longer close the PDF file; instead, it will navigate to the specific page of the PDF file.

### Known Bugs
- Sometimes, if the recording is too fast, it will not synchronize well with the slide presentation.
- Clicking on link on pdf will result in going to the webpage in the app and user can not go back.
- The pdf did not get rigiesterd in the trancription box
- 
### GROUND BREAKING BUG
-The data load time is very slow and needs to be fixed. You may experience this issue, but we are aware of it, and it will be addressed in the upcoming patch, version V1.0.1.

### Upcoming Features
- **Dark Mode and Custom Modes:** Dark mode and a custom mode of your own choice are currently in development.
- **Toggle Animation for High Performance on Laptops**: Added a feature to toggle animations on or off to enhance performance on laptops, particularly those with limited processing power. This option helps conserve battery life and ensures smoother operation when running multiple applications simultaneously.
-  Due to high user demand (particularly from students using laptops who have reported that the transcript function consumes a lot of performance), the next patch will allow you to keep recordings and generate transcripts only when you choose to do so.
- **Hovering Side Navigation:** A new feature will be added where, when a button is clicked, it will be highlighted so you know which page you are on.

  
### Deprecated
- Nothing deprecated.
